        <div class="line"></div>
        <p id="Info">Pierre-Emerick Emiliano François Aubameyang (born 18 June 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a forward and is the captain of both Premier League club Arsenal[5] and the Gabon national team. Aubameyang is renowned for his pace, finishing, and off-ball movement.[6] Aubameyang is widely considered to be one of the best forwards and finishers in world football.[7]

            The son of former Gabonese international Pierre Aubameyang, Aubameyang began his senior club career playing for Italian club A.C. Milan, but never appeared for the club as he went on a series of loan spells in France. He moved to Saint-Étienne in 2011. There, he won a Coupe de la Ligue title and joined Borussia Dortmund in 2013. In Germany, Aubameyang finished as the league's top goalscorer in the 2016–17 season and won a DFB-Pokal. He also ranks as the club's sixth highest all-time goalscorer.[8] In 2018, Aubameyang was the subject of a club record association football transfer when signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth £56 million (€60 million), making him the most expensive Gabonese player of all time.[9] With Arsenal, Aubameyang finished as the league's joint-top goalscorer in the 2018–19 season and won the FA Cup in 2020.</p>
